                <h2>Citrus Canker</h2>
                <p>
                    Caused by the bacterium <em>Xanthomonas citri</em>, Citrus Canker is a highly contagious disease. It appears as raised, tan or brown lesions on leaves, fruit, and stems. These lesions are often surrounded by a watery, yellow halo. Severe infections can lead to leaf drop, blemished fruit, and overall decline in tree health.

            <div class="disease-info">
                <h2>Black Spot</h2>
                <p>
                    Black Spot is a fungal disease caused by <em>Phyllosticta citricarpa</em>. It primarily affects the rind of citrus fruit, creating small, dark, and sunken lesions that make the fruit unmarketable. While it doesn't usually affect the taste, it severely reduces the commercial value. The fungus can also appear on leaves as small, round, grey spots with black borders.

                <h2>Greening (HLB)</h2>
                <p>
                    Also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), Greening is one of the most destructive citrus diseases worldwide. It is caused by a bacterium and spread by an insect, the Asian citrus psyllid. Symptoms include blotchy, asymmetrical yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, and the production of small, misshapen, and bitter-tasting fruit that remains partially green. There is currently no cure for this disease.

                <h2>Melanose</h2>
                <p>
                    Melanose is a fungal disease that affects the fruit, leaves, and twigs of citrus trees. It appears as numerous small, raised, dark-brown or black spots, giving the fruit a rough, sandpaper-like texture. While it is mostly a cosmetic issue that blemishes the fruit rind, severe infections can impact the tree's vitality. It is more common in areas with high rainfall and humidity.

                <h2>Healthy Leaf</h2>
                <p>
                    A healthy citrus leaf is the baseline for comparison. It should exhibit a uniform, vibrant dark green color. Key characteristics include a smooth, waxy surface and the absence of any spots, lesions, or unusual patterns like yellowing (chlorosis) or mottling. The leaf shape should be symmetrical and typical for the citrus variety. Recognizing a truly healthy leaf is fundamental for accurately identifying deviations caused by diseases or nutrient deficiencies.

        <!-- Severity Level Explanation -->
<div class="severity-section">
    <h2>Understanding Severity Levels</h2>
    <p>The model classifies disease severity into the following categories:</p>

    <ul class="severity-list">
        <li><strong>Healthy (&lt;5%)</strong> – No infection or extremely tiny affected area.</li>
        <li><strong>Mild (5%–20%)</strong> – Small portion of the leaf is affected.</li>
        <li><strong>Moderate (20%–50%)</strong> – Noticeable disease spread with clear symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Severe (&gt;50%)</strong> – Large portion is infected; high risk of leaf damage.</li>
    </ul>
